In CSS, only a limited set of properties are inherited by default. These are mostly text-related properties, such as color, font-family, font-size, line-height, letter-spacing, word-spacing, text-align, and visibility. These properties are automatically passed from a parent element to its children unless explicitly overridden. However, even inherited properties can be blocked or reset by browser default styles. For example, although font-family is an inheritable property, applying it on a parent container will not affect a <button> element by default because browsers apply their own built-in styles to elements like buttons, inputs, and headings. This is why selectors are often required when consistent styling is desired across all children.

On the other hand, the majority of CSS properties — such as background-color, margin, padding, border, width, height, display, position, z-index, box-shadow, and overflow — are not inherited by default. To apply these properties to children, they must be defined explicitly or enforced using selectors like .parent * { background-color: white; }. In some cases, you can use the inherit keyword to explicitly force a child to inherit a specific property, for example: background-color: inherit;
